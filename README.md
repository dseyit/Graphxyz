# Graphxyz
A tool for rapid scientific plots and analysis

The aim of this project is to develop free and open source application that can serve as all-in-one package to serve scientific community. As a physicist in North Carolina State University, this project had started as a result of my desire to have a tool to boost my efficiency during my PhD studies. Dealing with multiple instruments and tools can become frustrating during the analysis of the scientific data. As a result, I aim to address this issue by developing this simple software with graphical user interface.

If you find this project helpful for your own studies, please don't hesitate to contribute.

I am planning to publish demo videos <a href= 'https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnIIN0N92-SQEIZNQeXrzJw'> here </a>.

Documentation is also under construction. You are welcome to try without any guidance until then.
